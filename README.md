# Any funder

Decentralized sponsorship for everyone ‚ú®

## üìö Project walkthrough

This project ships with 2 main contracts,

- `AppRegistry.sol` - This is the registry if you're making a funding app to support multiple users
  and handle their contract deployment and unloading.
- `AnyFunder.sol` - This is the main app that is used on per-user basis. It has functions to pay an user in any
  currency you like and it's automatically swapped (thanks to uniswap protocols!) to the currency specified by
  the owner. And, you can withdraw all the funds that you have (native token/erc20) using the withdraw function.

The project also ships with a lot of useful libraries that you can use aswell for functionalities related
to currency handling.

- `CurrencyWrapper.sol` - This library has the functionality to wrap and unwrap native/erc20 tokens respectively.
  For example, you can wrap eth as weth, and unwrap it back. This works for _any_ native token and it's wrapped
  erc20 token format!
- `CurrencyTransfer.sol` - Having issues writing code to transfer funds, not anymore. This has options to transfer
  native token/erc20 funds easily, anywhere.
- `CurrencySwapper.sol` - The heart of this app - swapping mechanism with a lot of checks and edge case handling
  to make swapping native-erc20 tokens and vice versa easy in uniswap v3.

_Psst - we're looking to add a lot of amazing features for everyone, even features such as events and
crowdfunding!_
